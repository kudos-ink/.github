## Kudos for being here. Hi! 👋

Kudos is a [platform](https://morekudos.com) designed to streamline the process of onboarding new developers to the Polkadot Ecosystem. We make it simple to browse, search and filter open GitHub contributions across the entire ecosystem, allowing aspiring contributors to find projects and tasks, which match their skill level and interests. In addition, we provide project maintainers the ability to tag open contributions with custom incentives, ranging from native tokens, NFT’s, POAP’s and many more!
